One day I've decided to implement good habits into my daily routine. I feel much happier now. Next chapter describes what person needs to do daily to improve quality of life.
___
### Happy habits:
* Wake up at 6-6:30 AM.
* Raise your legs and arms and **shake** them well for a minute or two. Then tap your body well with palms of your hands.
* **Drink** a glass of hot water. 
* **Rub** yourself with dry brush across lymphatic lines. [Here is video how to do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFiv-zj8oog)
* Do vital **excercises**:
    1. _100_ sqauts ~~Don't stop, GO ON! You're doing great!~~
    2. _50_ push-ups
    3. _50_ sit-ups
    4. _50_ lifts for your back
* **Meditate** for 10 minutes. Read a quote >“Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.” – _Mahatma Gandhi_
* **Cook** nice healthy breakfast for your family. You can even have time to bake some poppy seed buns. Here is a recipe for you:

| `Ingridients`    | `Quantity`  |
